  what happens: >
    The balor, whose true name had been revealed to be **G'zzural Harvazari**,
    was unleashed by Edith a day prior by requesting to destroy the Bloodmoon
    Orb, is now wreaking havoc in the areas affected by the corruption.

    The dragon Aeroschlugpalar, the Gildenfire, is now battling this balor. Much of
    Aeroschugpalar's power is hindered by the effects of the Bloodmoon Orb however.

    NOTE TO DM: Evocation spells and Transmutation spells MUST BE WEAKENED!!
    Enchantment, Illusion and Necromancy enhanced for Shadow Weave users.
    (Edith, if DM rolls UNDER her passive intelligence (arcana))

    # Destroying the Bloodmoon Orbs

    The balor is able to destroy 2 of the 3 before the Gildenfire had intervened.
    Of course, this means it had also already destroyed and harmed a lot of the
    druids that had collected them.

    Since Edith knows the balor's name, this battle should be short, but the damage
    has been done. Aeroshlugpalar takes it in stride, spends time to lecture about
    the versatility of life: refer to [Mintiper's Chapbook Part 7]
    (https://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/mc/mc20010829g).

    Either way, Edith is trained in the arts of the druid. She is asked to do the
    following tasks:

    * Go into the other side of the forest, just beyond the corruption, start a fire
    * Czlear the boulders that have sealed a certain cave. Extract a Shambling Mound
      sapling and replant it just beyond the corruption.
    * Lure predators to hunt old animals, and some young as well.

  what happens: >
    Entering the Dire Wood, party is lead to a pocket dimension, hidden in a magical
    mist. Within the mists are Slaadi, Nothics and all sorts of aberrations, fiends
    and monstrosities with a hunger for anything emanating magical power.

    Hellgate Keep is a known access point to Baator and to the Abyss, and as such,
    all manners of such devils and demons use this place to enter the material plane.
    Here, the party would meet a group called the **Scoured Legion**, a once defunct
    army of fiend- and plane-touched creatures for hire. They seem to be preparing a
    new Tanarukk army for launching a new campaign. The army is in no way near ready
    though, but the lieutenants are currently hiring. Most of the leadership are
    tanar'ri of Grazzt.

      He has a hard-on for corrupting the innocent.
