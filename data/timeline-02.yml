- event: Edith and Hariq arrive at Boareskyr Bridge
  date: 27 Ches 1489 DR
  description: >
    Travel along the High Road had been slowed due to some damage to the famous
    [Boareskyr Bridge](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Boareskyr_Bridge).\n\n

    A huge typhoon and the resulting overflow of the
    [Winding Water]http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Winding_Water) had
    collapsed a large section of the black granite bridge, and thus had been
    rendered impassable to horses, much less carriages.\n\n

    The caravan that Edith Tarnalis, a cleric of Chauntea, and Hariq Ilqalba,
    a nobleman-mage from the deserts of
    [Calimshan](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Calimshan) had travelled with
    was forced to take refuge in one of the many roadside "inns" in the tent-city
    that surrounds the bridge.\n\n

- event: Kidnapping at the Boareskyr Bridge
  date: 27 Ches 1489 DR
  description: >
    Some children in the tent-city that surrounds Boareskyr Bridge had disappeared.
    It seems that kidnapped children is, sadly, not a rare event in the area, due
    to a very active slave market in the Serpent Hills run by the Yuan-Ti.\n\n

    Edith and Hariq had teamed-up to take back these children away from the slavers,
    and had hurriedly followed their trail. What they found, however, was smashed
    carriage and some footprints that seems to indicate that the smugglers and the
    children have fled into the woods that led to the
    [High Moor](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/High_Moor).\n\n

    The team had found themselved chased by a Banshee until they reached a small
    cabin. This cabin, apparently, had also been where the smugglers and the children
    had taken refuge from the same Banshee, who, for some reason, cannot enter.\n\n

    Edith had discovered that the cabin was protected magically, by a consecrated
    dagger dedicated to the dwarven god
    [Haela Brightaxe](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Haela_Brightaxe),
    the Luckmaiden. Hariq, on the other hand, discovered a trapdoor hidden under
    some rubble.\n\n

    Edith had, with Hariq's help, sneaked the children into the trapdoor as she
    removed the consecrated dagger from the alter. This had removed the protection
    of the cabin, and in effect, forced, and had successfully navigated, a battle
    between them, the smugglers, and the banshee.\n\n

    As the team began taking stock of the children they had rescued, however, it
    seems two children have disappeared. These two, one of the children had seen,
    had wanted to explore that lay beneath the trapdoor.\n\n

    Edith had requested that Hariq might return these children to the tent-city
    of Boareskyr, and that she would take the two children back herself.

    Unfortunately
    however, Edith had soon learned that the two children were taken by some strange
    hooded figures in black robes into an ancient elven temple.\n\n

    As Edith had followed them, she had found that these figures were followers of
    the dark goddess Shar. They had performed a strange ritual that involved opening
    the chest cavities of the children and placing orbs into them.
- event: Edith and Hariq Arrive at Greenest
  date: 2 Tarsahk 1489 DR
  description: >
    The caravan that Edith and Hariq had travelled with had finally arrived at
    Greenest, where Edith had been required to travel to by the Abbot of the
    Goldenfields. They had found that Greenest, as well as most villages in the
    Greenfields had been ravaged. A group called the Cult of the Dragon had sacked
    the town and the surrounding villages.\n\n

    The party also heard that the actions of a Magna Mistwinter had ensured that
    Greenest had survived the raids.\n\n

    In the shadow of night, Edith and Hariq had overheard some men talking in the
    darkness. It was mentioned that **Hazirawn** had been put in the hands of
    Rezmir. Edith had then captured one of the men in order to get more information,
    but alas, was not able to get anything more substantial.

- event: Candlekeep is infiltrated by mysterious cultists
  date: 5 Tarsahk 1489 DR
  description: >
    In order to glean upon some of the mysteries presented by the past few days,
    the party had travelled to the Great Library of Candlekeep. As they arrive
    however, they are turned away due to some incident within the confines of the
    library.\n\n

    After some coercing, Edith had fished out that there were some people that had
    forced themselves into a secret portion of the library. The intruders wanted
    to take what the Avowed scholars call the **Alterable States**. A set of
    prophecies made by the great seer Alaundro which depend upon the fulfillment
    of conditions at certain important temporal junctures. Knowing which conditions
    to alter would theoretically allow anyone to select the most favorable outcome
    predetermined by Alaundro's prophetic wisdom.\n\n

    They had found a female Avowed monk who had taken a vow of silence, and assumed
    that perhaps she had the key to these states. Edith and Hariq had successfully
    rescued her from the clutches of these intruders.\n\n

    After which, the party began reading about Shar and the tarrasque. The trail
    seemed to have led them towards Evereska.

- event: Trouble at the Brown Bear
  date: 10 Tarsahk 1489 DR
  description: >
    Edith and Hariq had arrived at Baldur's Gate. Where they had headed to Elfsong
    Tavern which is owned by Edith's friend, Gigi Glamorous. Edith had asked her about
    the child slave/prostitution trade in Baldur's Gate in order to check if children
    are possibly being taken by Sharrans.\n\n

    Gigi told them that a tavern called the **Brown Bear** in the Outer City's Muskrat
    district is the center of child trafficking in the area. Hariq had remembered that
    a cousin of his from the Little Calimshan district might know about the
    establishment.\n\n

    They headed towards Little Calimshan, a small calishite settlement in the middle
    of the Outer City, where Hariq's cousin, Roman Ilqalba had taken residence. Indeed
    Roman was a frequent patron of the Brown Bear. After a few flattering words from
    Edith, Roman agreed to ensure that Edith and Hariq may enter the Brown Bear as
    customers.\n\n

    Inside the tavern, the secret sex den had a stable of many children, boys and
    girls, all aged 12 and below. In order to keep appearances Edith had offered
    to take a 12 year old boy named Drew.\n\n

    Edith had then began to question Drew if he had heard of any problems with the sex
    trade, in exchange for his freedom. He did overhear some of the slavers that there
    were some "shipments" that had gone missing.\n\n

    Edith had made good on her promise with Drew and had staged a fire at the Brown
    Bear, and they would act as if they had kept the establishment from burning.
    Fortunately, their gambit had worked, and as a reward, had received Drew as
    payment.

- event: The Cloakwood and the Orb
  date: 11 Tarsahk 1489 DR
  description: >
    After rescuing Drew, Edith had led the party towards the temple of Chauntea in the
    area. Just past midnight, they had knocked at the door of the temple waking
    Sister Elsa.\n\n

    In the morning, Edith and Hariq met High Priest Mike Shinoda while watering
    plants. After Edith had recounted all that had befallen her until the events
    at Greenest. Mike had then mentioned that a member of the congregation's child
    had been missing for a day or so now, and that they had lived in a homestead
    across the river Chionthar.\n\n

    As visited the homestead Father Mike had mentioned, the party had met the poor
    farmer whose son had gone missing. He said that they had tracked the child to the
    Cloakwood, but none had the courage to enter, including himself. It had been said
    that any who enter are as good as dead. Edith and Hariq had offered to venture
    into the wood, to at the very least, recover the child's body.\n\n

    The Cloakwood was dark and moist and full of giant spiders that had continually
    attacked the party as they moved deep inside. Eventually, the party had reached
    a clearing with a makeshift altar built in the center. Upon the altar was a boy.
    Surrounding it were more children, and some men in dark robes similar to the ones
    worn by the cultists Edith had found in the High Moor. They also had a black orb
    of sacrifice. They were about to perform the ritual to create a Bloodmoon Orb.\n\n

    Before they can react however, Edith and Hariq had dispatched the cultists, and
    at the same time, destroy the orb of sacrifice. The destruction of the orb,
    however had dispelled magical effects in the area, including one that had been
    cast by Lareal and Alassra Silverhand on Edith, spells that had altered her
    memory and her physical appearance.\n\n

    As the magical effects had receeded, Edith suddenly sprouted wings, then fainted.
    It was revealed that Edith was in fact, an aasimar with angelic origins.\n\n

- event: Erys Jerend, revived
  date: 12 Tarsahk 1489 DR
  description: >
    Edith had woken up in the Baldur's Gate temple of Chauntea after her dreams had
    torrented her with with once-forgotten memories. She began to remember her past as
    Erys Jerend, a child kidnapped and turned into an assassin by the Dark Followers
    of Shar. Her short but prolific career had earned her the moniker, the "Darkwing".

    Edith believes that they have no time to rest, however, and tells Hariq that they
    must continue to Evereska. Father Mike, however, had said that it might not be a
    good idea to leave Drew in Baldur's Gate where the proprietors of the Brown Bear
    might be able to see him. They all decided then to bring Drew to the Goldenfields,
    a walled farmland/abbey dedicated to the goddess Chauntea.

    To prepare, the party headed to the docks in order to buy passage in a ship bound
    for Waterdeep the next morning. They had also purchased new equipment for Edith,
    since her body features had changed, most notably, that she had grown wings.

    Edith had then visited the Elfsong tavern alone for some enjoyment and
    information. She had asked Gigi more about the child trafficking trade, who
    responded by offering to introduce Edith to one of the Zhentarim who had
    connections to this trade. Gigi asks Edith to return sometime later at night.

    After resting, the party headed back to Elfsong to meet Gigi's Zhentarim liason.
    Standing with Gigi in her quarters, they met a mysterious woman in short leathers
    called Bethshaba. Bethshaba was in charge of the sex trade in and around Baldur's
    Gate, and had information regarding the lost "merchandise" that Drew had overheard
    in the Brown Bear.

    Apart from pertinent, but incomplete information regarding the trade, Bethshaba
    also had let slip that a Zhentarim agent was travelling with Magna Mistwinter
    before they had all parted.

    On the way back to the temple of Chauntea, Edith had revealed to Hariq that she
    had this dark desire to be enveloped and showered by men's sperm.

- event: Edith and Hariq take a ride to Waterdeep
  date: 13 Tarsahk 1489 DR
  description: >
    First thing in the morning, the party had taken some items they had ordered the
    day before, then headed towards the ship called **The Titan of Zalazuu** in order
    to embark on their journey to Waterdeep.

    Ship Manifest:

    * Captain: Zorah Norond, Goliath, Halruaa
    * First Officer: Mazzad Dur, Watersoul Genasi, Halruaa
    * Crew:
      - Pastrami Potato, Gnome, Amn
      - Bologna Potato, Gnome, Amn
      - Chorizo Potato, Gnome, Amn
    * Passengers:
      - Lilith Chase, Aasimar, Goldenfields, Cleric
      - Tobee, Firesoul Genasi, Calimshan, Evoker
      - Korrine Rasparian, Human, Amn, Merchant
      - Sir Haemar Panstrom, Human, Tethyr, Knight Vigilant Paladin of Helm
      - Lady Jasmine Montaun, Gnome, Baldur's Gate, Noblewoman

    The party had rested almost as soon as they had embarked, and had woken up just
    in time for lunch. At lunchtime, they had met the captain Zorah Norond, a goliath
    from Halruaa, the first officer Mazzad Dur, a very dour and silent Watersoul
    Genasi, Sir Haemar Panstrom, a friendly Tethyrian Paladin of Helm headed to
    Waterdeep for reassignment, Korrine Rasparian, a rich merchant's widow making
    her way to Waterdeep to manage her deceased husband's affairs, and Lady Jasmine
    Montaun, a gnomish noblewoman from Baldur's Gate who seemed to have a very keen
    interest in Edith's (who had introduced herself as Lilith) wings.

    After lunch, the party had gone on deck to enjoy the view, where they were
    followed by Lady Jasmine. After a bit of small talk, she had revealed that she is
    really Jamna Gleamsilver, a Zhentarim agent of high renown in their organization
    and that she knows the party's true identities and purpose.

    She shared with them details about the slave trade that Bethshaba left out. She
    had also confirmed that Magna Mistwinter had succumbed to vampirism.

    En route, the Titan of Zalazuu had been attacked by a wayward Merrow and its
    Octopus minions. The party had helped battle these creatures, but the damage
    to the ship had been reportedly extensive, and the captain mentioned that he
    did not want to risk the voyage. They take a detour to Mintarn for repairs,
    which is apparently fortunate for Jamna, as she had some business to deal with
    in Mintarn. She had offered a deal--if Edith and Hariq helped her with her issues,
    she would do everything in her power to halt the child trafficking business in
    Baldur's Gate. They agreed.

- event: Arrival at Mintarn
  date: 14 Tarsahk 1489 DR
  description: >
    Just before the ship had docked at Mintarn, Edith had met with Jamna in the
    latter's room for a briefing on the mission the party was about to undertake.

    An associate of Jamna's was interested in building a fleet of ships on Mintarn
    and had wanted to staff it with the island's most reputable mercenary sailors.
    However, ship production wasn't going as fast as expected. She and her associate
    had reason to believe that the local ruler, **Tyrant Tarnheel Embuirhan** may
    have somehow caused these delays. Jamna had thought that the Tyrant was getting
    too out of control, and needed to be reeled in.

    The mission was to find dirt on Tarnheel so that Jamna can use the information
    as blackmail material. However, if it had seemed to the party that Tarnheel
    was beyond control, the party must report the information to Jamna, and she would
    judge whether it would be better to just end his life right then and there.

    As the ship had finally docked, the party had followed Jamna in order to use
    her associate's estate as a base of operations. The paldin, Sir Haemar had stayed
    at the local branch of the Chum Bucket, one of a chain of inn/taverns own by
    Jamna herself.

    For lunch, in order to catch a glimpse of Tarnheel, Jamna had brought the party
    to the **Selective Sailor's Saloon and Inn**, the swankiest place in Mintarn.
    It turns out that Miss Korrine had booked a room there as soon as they had left
    the ship, and decided unilaterally, to join the party in their revels.

    As Tarnheel had entered the saloon, Edith quickly pointed out to Korrine that
    the Tyrant had sneaked a quick glance at her, and had goaded the widow to
    introduce herself. Being the suave creature that she is, Tarnheel had been quickly
    taken in by Korrine, who had promptly asked her to join him in his VIP table.
    Korrine just as promptly, agreed.

    Shortly afterward, Jamna and the party depart and had headed to their base of
    operations so they may begin. Jamna had suggested that they begin by looking into
    the **Bikini Bottom Shipyard Company (BBSC)**, a company that she herself had a
    stake in. They were the company commisioned to complete the ships her associate
    had ordered, but for some unknown reasons, production had been fraught by delays.

- event: Bikini Bottom Shipyard Company
  date: 14 Tarsahk 1489 DR
  description: >
    The party had done as Jamna had suggested, and headed to the Bikini Bottom
    Shipyard Company drydock, where they met with its foreman, a venerable old man
    named **Ortmann Finnwheel**. Edith had convinced him that she was Lilith Chase,
    daughter of a lumbermill owner from the island of **Gwynneth**, and that her
    father had sent her to find clients for their fledgling business. She had, Edith
    lied, wanted to check the risks involved. Ortmann, perhaps out of desperation,
    had instantly revealed their lumber supply chain, and their problems. BBSC had
    sourced their lumber from many locales, in order to ensure a good supply chain,
    30% of which came from continental places such as Daggerford and Baldur's Gate.
    The largest supplier, however, was from the nearby island of Alaron which supplied
    up to 70% of the construction material. Apart from being, and perhaps because of,
    Alaron's closer proximity, the material costs were much lower than lumber from
    those from the continent.

    Lumber from Alaron, however, suddenly became problematic. The lumber from the
    island had been rotting in transit for almost a month at this point. Lumber from
    the area of Daggerford had been reportedly the target of pirate raids.

    Also, while lumber supplied from Baldur's Gate did not face similar issues, the
    sheer distance of the city meant that resupply was slow and very cost-prohibitive.
    If Lilith, he said, could bring a shipment of 1000 pcs. of lumber in the next few
    days, Ortmann would be willing to pay 1200 gp per shipment of 100 pcs.

    Asked what the Tyrant was doing about the matter, Ortmann had responded that the
    island's infrastracture was run by individuals who had only a vague respect for
    the local goverment. There were three divisions mentioned: The Mercenary Guild,
    arguably the most powerful group in the island, was led by **Pompin Munarkus
    Elhus**. The Fire Brigade, which had the job of ensuring that the island's mostly
    wooden structures were protected from spreading fire was led by **Dana Crassus**.
    Finally, the Peacekeeping Militia, which had been given the task of ensuring peace
    and order in and around Mintarn, was led by **Julio Kasar**. These three leaders
    have been dubbed by the island's inhabitants as **Mintarn's Triumvirate**.

- event: The Triumvirate and Shrooms
  date: 14 Tarsahk 1489 DR
  description: >
    In order to learn more about the power structure of the island's government, Edith
    had brought Hariq to the various group headquarters to submit applications.

    The first place they had applied to was the Mercenary Guild, which was located just
    across the Selective Sailor's Saloon and Inn. Upon arrival, they were met by
    **Rachel Arnada**, one of Munarkus's liutenants. She apparently, was in charge
    of new recruits, as Munarkus is a very busy individual. Rachel said, that in
    order to join the mercenary guild, they would have to pass a test. A test
    that would be given to them the next day.

    Next, the party had visited the Fire Brigade above the wo

- event: Edith and Hariq head to the Goldenfields
  date: 24 Tarsahk 1489 DR
  description: >
    Edith and Hariq, headed to the **Goldenfields**, a walled farmland and abbey
    dedicated to the goddess Chauntea, in order to report what Edith had learned to
    Abbott Renault McLaren.

    Upon arrival, however, the Abbott was occupied by issues with the fruit yield
    from an area of the Goldenfields called **The Orchards**, which, as the name
    implies, houses the orchards of fruit trees in the walled farmland. The crux of
    the matter was due to a contamination of the water source that led to the
    irrigation system by some especially toxic material. This had substantially
    affected the health of the trees and had rendered the fruits nearing ripeness,
    contaminated and inedible.

    Even before Edith could explain her situation, and the growth of her wings, the
    Abbott had already sent them on an errand to investigate the matter, as the toxic
    material seemed to have come from upstream of the River Dessarin. The party took
    some horses and had rode upriver to find the source of the pollutants. Quickly
    enough, they had found the source to be a new mine near the edges of the Dessarin
    Valley, which was dumping some by-product arsenic straight to the river.

    The party had confronted the owner of the mine, who had at first merely shrugged
    off any question of pollutants. That was, until Edith had mentioned that they
    were sent by the administration of the Goldenfields. Delta Remore, the proprietor
    of the mine, had respected the importance of the Goldenfields as the breadbasket
    of the North and had instantly taken heed. He had made a show of chastising his
    subordinates for dumping pollutants into the river, and had promised profusely
    that he would pay remuneration for any and all damage he had inadvertently dealt
    to the crops. In addition, he would make a huge donation to the Church of Chauntea
    that runs the Goldenfields as thanks for their bounty and benevolence.

    Considering the matter settled, Edith and Hariq had begun to prepare to depart
    when a Orcish raiding party had made its presence known. The raiding party was
    strange, however. It was very organized and militaristic, that it seemed more
    like a professionally trained army squadron advancing tactically than a simple
    orcish raid.

    Once the party had beaten the orcish contingent, Edith had stabilized then
    interrogated its warchief. This group of warriors, who rode under the banner of
    King Obould XIX, was ambushed and left for dead by a rival orcish faction. This
    rival faction was one of the many who had supported the insurrection against King
    Obould XVIII. According to this warchief, the civil war had been bloody,
    threatening to undo the peace that Obould XVII had reforged just a generation
    prior.

    Edith had set the orc free, on the condition that he must tell his superiors that
    his contingent had _not_ been attacked by a rival faction--instead by supporters
    of the Cult of the Dragon, who had threatened to take the Northlands by force once
    Tiamat had been released from her hellish prison.

    Deeming the mission complete, the party had headed back to the Goldenfields,
    taking a rest in a nearby glade.

- event: Edith dreams about the ancient evil
  date: 25 Tarsahk 1489 DR
  description: >
    After returning to the Goldenfields, Edith and Hariq had reported their findings
    to the Abbott. The Abbott also then gave Edith the story of how she ended up in
    the Goldenfields.

    In the afternoon, after taking Drew and Hariq on a tour around the farmlands,
    Edith had fallen asleep in her cottage. She dreamt about a hunting lodge atop a
    mountain, where a blackened creature with bat-like wings had erupted out of one of
    the lodge's windows. It was then chased by a naked red-headed woman, who Edith had
    correctly guessed was Magna Mistwinter.

    After some revelry, Edith and Hariq said goodbye to Drew and headed back to
    Waterdeep.

    The party had arrived at Waterdeep and headed straight to the Yawning Portal Inn,
    known to many an adventurer as the entrance to the Undermountain. There, the
    Simbul had waited for the party in disguise. She had told the party that she
    had already arranged for a meeting between them and the current matriarch of the
    Niral family.

    They had met Lady Trajenta Niral, who had wanted nothing to do with the Naral
    family her family was an offshoot of.

    They had also met Monica Niral, child of the wayward Marius Naral. They have
    discovered the Naral family had not subscribed to the orthodox Church of Shar,
    but instead to the controversial Dark Moon heresy.

    They descend into the Undermountain.
