 - event: Edith and Hariq arrive at Boareskyr Bridge
   date: 27 Ches 1489 DR
   description: >
     Travel along the High Road had been slowed due to some damage to the famous
     [Boareskyr Bridge](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Boareskyr_Bridge).\n\n

     A huge typhoon and the resulting overflow of the
     [Winding Water](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Winding_Water) had
     collapsed a large section of the black granite bridge, and thus had been
     rendered impassable to horses, much less carriages.\n\n

     The caravan that Edith Tarnalis, a cleric of Chauntea, and Hariq Ilqalba,
     a nobleman-mage from the deserts of
     [Calimshan](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Calimshan) had travelled with
     was forced to take refuge in one of the many roadside "inns" in the tent-city
     that surrounds the bridge.\n\n

 - event: Kidnapping at the Boareskyr Bridge
   date: 27 Ches 1489 DR
   description: >
     Some children in the tent-city that surrounds Boareskyr Bridge had disappeared.
     It seems that kidnapped children is, sadly, not a rare event in the area, due
     to a very active slave market in the Serpent Hills run by the Yuan-Ti.\n\n

     Edith and Hariq had teamed-up to take back these children away from the slavers,
     and had hurriedly followed their trail. What they found, however, was smashed
     carriage and some footprints that seems to indicate that the smugglers and the
     children have fled into the woods that led to the
     [High Moor](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/High_Moor).\n\n

     The team had found themselved chased by a Banshee until they reached a small
     cabin. This cabin, apparently, had also been where the smugglers and the children
     had taken refuge from the same Banshee, who, for some reason, cannot enter.\n\n

     Edith had discovered that the cabin was protected magically, by a consecrated
     dagger dedicated to the dwarven god
     [Haela Brightaxe](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Haela_Brightaxe),
     the Luckmaiden. Hariq, on the other hand, discovered a trapdoor hidden under
     some rubble.\n\n

     Edith had, with Hariq's help, sneaked the children into the trapdoor as she
     removed the consecrated dagger from the alter. This had removed the protection
     of the cabin, and in effect, forced, and had successfully navigated, a battle
     between them, the smugglers, and the banshee.\n\n

     As the team began taking stock of the children they had rescued, however, it
     seems two children have disappeared. These two, one of the children had seen,
     had wanted to explore that lay beneath the trapdoor.\n\n

     Edith had requested that Hariq might return these children to the tent-city
     of Boareskyr, and that she would take the two children back herself.

     Unfortunately
     however, Edith had soon learned that the two children were taken by some strange
     hooded figures in black robes into an ancient elven temple.\n\n

     As Edith had followed them, she had found that these figures were followers of
     the dark goddess Shar. They had performed a strange ritual that involved opening
     the chest cavities of the children and placing orbs into them.
 - event: Edith and Hariq Arrive at Greenest
   date: 2 Tarsahk 1489 DR
   description: >
     The caravan that Edith and Hariq had travelled with had finally arrived at
     Greenest, where Edith had been required to travel to by the Abbot of the
     Goldenfields. They had found that Greenest, as well as most villages in the
     Greenfields had been ravaged. A group called the Cult of the Dragon had sacked
     the town and the surrounding villages.\n\n

     The party also heard that the actions of a Magna Mistwinter had ensured that
     Greenest had survived the raids.\n\n

     In the shadow of night, Edith and Hariq had overheard some men talking in the
     darkness. It was mentioned that **Hazirawn** had been put in the hands of
     Rezmir. Edith had then captured one of the men in order to get more information,
     but alas, was not able to get anything more substantial.

 - event: Candlekeep is infiltrated by mysterious cultists
   date: 5 Tarsahk 1489 DR
   description: >
     In order to glean upon some of the mysteries presented by the past few days,
     the party had travelled to the Great Library of Candlekeep. As they arrive
     however, they are turned away due to some incident within the confines of the
     library.\n\n

     After some coercing, Edith had fished out that there were some people that had
     forced themselves into a secret portion of the library. The intruders wanted
     to take what the Avowed scholars call the **Alterable States**. A set of
     prophecies made by the great seer Alaundro which depend upon the fulfillment
     of conditions at certain important temporal junctures. Knowing which conditions
     to alter would theoretically allow anyone to select the most favorable outcome
     predetermined by Alaundro's prophetic wisdom.\n\n

     They had found a female Avowed monk who had taken a vow of silence, and assumed
     that perhaps she had the key to these states. Edith and Hariq had successfully
     rescued her from the clutches of these intruders.\n\n

     After which, the party began reading about Shar and the tarrasque. The trail
     seemed to have led them towards Evereska.

 - event: Trouble at the Brown Bear
   date: 10 Tarsahk 1489 DR
   description: >
     Edith and Hariq had arrived at Baldur's Gate. Where they had headed to Elfsong
     Tavern which is owned by Edith's friend, Gigi Glamorous. Edith had asked her about
     the child slave/prostitution trade in Baldur's Gate in order to check if children
     are possibly being taken by Sharrans.\n\n

     Gigi told them that a tavern called the **Brown Bear** in the Outer City's Muskrat
     district is the center of child trafficking in the area. Hariq had remembered that
     a cousin of his from the Little Calimshan district might know about the
     establishment.\n\n

     They headed towards Little Calimshan, a small calishite settlement in the middle
     of the Outer City, where Hariq's cousin, Roman Ilqalba had taken residence. Indeed
     Roman was a frequent patron of the Brown Bear. After a few flattering words from
     Edith, Roman agreed to ensure that Edith and Hariq may enter the Brown Bear as
     customers.\n\n

     Inside the tavern, the secret sex den had a stable of many children, boys and
     girls, all aged 12 and below. In order to keep appearances Edith had offered
     to take a 12 year old boy named Drew.\n\n

     Edith had then began to question Drew if he had heard of any problems with the sex
     trade, in exchange for his freedom. He did overhear some of the slavers that there
     were some "shipments" that had gone missing.\n\n

     Edith had made good on her promise with Drew and had staged a fire at the Brown
     Bear, and they would act as if they had kept the establishment from burning.
     Fortunately, their gambit had worked, and as a reward, had received Drew as
     payment.

 - event: The Cloakwood and the Orb
   date: 11 Tarsahk 1489 DR
   description: >
     After rescuing Drew, Edith had led the party towards the temple of Chauntea in the
     area. Just past midnight, they had knocked at the door of the temple waking
     Sister Elsa.\n\n

     In the morning, Edith and Hariq met High Priest Mike Shinoda while watering
     plants. After Edith had recounted all that had befallen her until the events
     at Greenest. Mike had then mentioned that a member of the congregation's child
     had been missing for a day or so now, and that they had lived in a homestead
     across the river Chionthar.\n\n

     As visited the homestead Father Mike had mentioned, the party had met the poor
     farmer whose son had gone missing. He said that they had tracked the child to the
     Cloakwood, but none had the courage to enter, including himself. It had been said
     that any who enter are as good as dead. Edith and Hariq had offered to venture
     into the wood, to at the very least, recover the child's body.\n\n

     The Cloakwood was dark and moist and full of giant spiders that had continually
     attacked the party as they moved deep inside. Eventually, the party had reached
     a clearing with a makeshift altar built in the center. Upon the altar was a boy.
     Surrounding it were more children, and some men in dark robes similar to the ones
     worn by the cultists Edith had found in the High Moor. They also had a black orb
     of sacrifice. They were about to perform the ritual to create a Bloodmoon Orb.\n\n

     Before they can react however, Edith and Hariq had dispatched the cultists, and
     at the same time, destroy the orb of sacrifice. The destruction of the orb,
     however had dispelled magical effects in the area, including one that had been
     cast by Lareal and Alassra Silverhand on Edith, spells that had altered her
     memory and her physical appearance.\n\n

     As the magical effects had receeded, Edith suddenly sprouted wings, then fainted.
     It was revealed that Edith was in fact, an aasimar with angelic origins.\n\n


 - event: Erys Jerend, revived
   date: 12 Tarsahk 1489 DR
   description: >
     Edith had woken up in the Baldur's Gate temple of Chauntea after her dreams had
     torrented her with with once-forgotten memories. She began to remember her past as
     Erys Jerend, a child kidnapped and turned into an assassin by the Dark Followers
     of Shar. Her short but prolific career had earned her the moniker, the "Darkwing".

     Edith believes that they have no time to rest, however, and tells Hariq that they
     must continue to Evereska. Father Mike, however, had said that it might not be a
     good idea to leave Drew in Baldur's Gate where the proprietors of the Brown Bear
     might be able to see him. They all decided then to bring Drew to the Goldenfields,
     a walled farmland/abbey dedicated to the goddess Chauntea.

     To prepare, the party headed to the docks in order to buy passage in a ship bound
     for Waterdeep the next morning. They had also purchased new equipment for Edith,
     since her body features had changed, most notably, that she had grown wings.

     Edith had then visited the Elfsong tavern alone for some enjoyment and
     information. She had asked Gigi more about the child trafficking trade, who
     responded by offering to introduce Edith to one of the Zhentarim who had
     connections to this trade. Gigi asks Edith to return sometime later at night.

     After resting, the party headed back to Elfsong to meet Gigi's Zhentarim liason.
     Standing with Gigi in her quarters, they met a mysterious woman in short leathers
     called Bethshaba. Bethshaba was in charge of the sex trade in and around Baldur's
     Gate, and had information regarding the lost "merchandise" that Drew had overheard
     in the Brown Bear.

     Apart from pertinent, but incomplete information regarding the trade, Bethshaba
     also had let slip that a Zhentarim agent was travelling with Magna Mistwinter
     before they had all parted.

     On the way back to the temple of Chauntea, Edith had revealed to Hariq that she
     had this dark desire to be enveloped and showered by men's sperm.


 - event: Edith and Hariq take a ride to Waterdeep
   date: 13 Tarsahk 1489 DR
   description: >
     First thing in the morning, the party had taken some items they had ordered the
     day before, then headed towards the ship called **The Titan of Zalazuu** in order
     to embark on their journey to Waterdeep.

     Ship Manifest:
     * Captain: Zorah Norond, Goliath, Halruaa
     * First Officer: Mazzad Dur, Watersoul Genasi, Halruaa
     * Crew:
     ** Pastrami Potato, Gnome, Amn
     ** Bologna Potato, Gnome, Amn
     ** Chorizo Potato, Gnome, Amn
     * Passengers:
     ** Lilith Chase, Aasimar, Goldenfields, Cleric
     ** Tobee, Firesoul Genasi, Calimshan, Evoker
     ** Korrine Rasparian, Human, Amn, Merchant
     ** Sir Haemar Panstrom, Human, Tethyr, Knight Vigilant Paladin of Helm
     ** Lady Jasmine Montaun, Gnome, Baldur's Gate, Noblewoman

     The party had rested almost as soon as they had embarked, and had woken up just
     in time for lunch. At lunchtime, they had met the captain Zorah Norond, a goliath
     from Halruaa, the first officer Mazzad Dur, a very dour and silent Watersoul
     Genasi, Sir Haemar Panstrom, a friendly Tethyrian Paladin of Helm headed to
     Waterdeep for reassignment, Korrine Rasparian, a rich merchant's widow making
     her way to Waterdeep to manage her deceased husband's affairs, and Lady Jasmine
     Montaun, a gnomish noblewoman from Baldur's Gate who seemed to have a very keen
     interest in Edith's (who had introduced herself as Lilith) wings.

     After lunch, the party had gone on deck to enjoy the view, where they were
     followed by Lady Jasmine. After a bit of small talk, she had revealed that she is
     really Jamna Gleamsilver, a Zhentarim agent of high renown in their organization
     and that she knows the party's true identities and purpose.

     She shared with them details about the slave trade that Bethshaba left out. She
     had also confirmed that Magna Mistwinter had succumbed to vampirism.

     En route, the Titan of Zalazuu had been attacked by a wayward Merrow and its
     Octopus minions. The party had helped battle these creatures, but the damage
     to the ship had been reportedly extensive, and the captain mentioned that he
     did not want to risk the voyage. They take a detour to Mintarn for repairs,
     which is apparently fortunate for Jamna, as she had some business to deal with
     in Mintarn. She had offered a deal--if Edith and Hariq helped her with her issues,
     she would do everything in her power to halt the child trafficking business in
     Baldur's Gate. They agreed.

 - event: Arrival at Mintarn, Bikini Bottom Shipyard Company
   date: 14 Tarsahk 1489 DR
   description: >
     Just before the ship had docked at Mintarn, Edith had met with Jamna in the
     latter's room for a briefing on the mission the party was about to undertake.

     An associate of Jamna's was interested in building a fleet of ships on Mintarn
     and had wanted to staff it with the island's most reputable mercenary sailors.
     However, ship production wasn't going as fast as expected. She and her associate
     had reason to believe that the local ruler, **Tyrant Tarnheel Embuirhan** may
     have somehow caused these delays. Jamna had thought that the Tyrant was getting
     too out of control, and needed to be reeled in.

     The mission was to find dirt on Tarnheel so that Jamna can use the information
     as blackmail material. However, if it had seemed to the party that Tarnheel
     was beyond control, the party must report the information to Jamna, and she would
     judge whether it would be better to just end his life right then and there.

     As the ship had finally docked, the party had followed Jamna in order to use
     her associate's estate as a base of operations. The paldin, Sir Haemar had stayed
     at the local branch of the Chum Bucket, one of a chain of inn/taverns own by
     Jamna herself.

     For lunch, in order to catch a glimpse of Tarnheel, Jamna had brought the party
     to the **Selective Sailor's Saloon and Inn**, the swankiest place in Mintarn.
     It turns out that Miss Korrine had booked a room there as soon as they had left
     the ship, and decided unilaterally, to join the party in their revels.

     As Tarnheel had entered the saloon, Edith quickly pointed out to Korrine that
     the Tyrant had sneaked a quick glance at her, and had goaded the widow to
     introduce herself. Being the suave creature that she is, Tarnheel had been quickly
     taken in by Korrine, who had promptly asked her to join him in his VIP table.
     Korrine just as promptly, agreed.

     Shortly afterward, Jamna and the party depart and had headed to their base of
     operations so they may begin. Jamna had suggested that they begin by looking into
     the **Bikini Bottom Shipyard Company (BBSC)**, a company that she herself had a
     stake in. They were the company commisioned to complete the ships her associate
     had ordered, but for some unknown reasons, production had been fraught by delays.

     The party had done as Jamna had suggested, and headed to the BBSC drydock, where
     they met with its foreman, a venerable old man named **Ortmann Finnwheel**.
     Edith had convinced him that she was Lilith Chase, daughter of a lumbermill owner
     from **Gwynneth**, and that her father had sent her to find clients for their
     fledgling business. She had, of course, wanted to check the risks involved. Ortmann had revealed that Alaron is their biggest supplier of
     lumber next is Daggerford and Baldur's gate. The lumbers from Daggerford had been
     the target of their raids while Baldur's Gate doesn't have this problems but the
     supply is slow and expensive. Ortmann also rants about the lumbers that they received
     from Alaron seems to rot upon its arrival in Mintarn. If Lilith can bring a shipment
     of 1000 pcs. of lumber in the next few days, Ortmann is willing to pay 1200 GP per
     shipment of 100 pcs.

     The party also learned about the three pillars that support Mintarn's infrastracture.
     The Mercenary Guild led by Pompin Munarkus Elhus, The Fire brigade led by Dana Crassus
     and the Peacekeeping militia led by Julio Kasar. Also known as Mintarn's the Triumvirate.

     Edith had signed up

     Edith and Hariq, with the child Drew in tow, head to the **Goldenfields**, a
     walled farmland and abbey dedicated to the goddess Chauntea, in order to report
     to the Abbott Renault McLaren.

     As they arrive, however, it seems that the Abbott had been busy dealing with an
     issue with the yield of fruit taken from an area of the Goldenfields called **The
     Orchards**. The water source seemed to have been contaminated with a significant
     level of toxic material, which had affected the health of most of the trees. Those
     trees whose fruits had already grown, were similarly contaminated, and thus deemed
     unfit for consumption.

     Before the Abbott even lets Edith speak, she was sent to investigate the matter.
