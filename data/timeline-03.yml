- event: Harpers fail to retake the Green Dragon Mask in Kryptgarden Forest
  date: 24 Ches 1489 DR
  description: >
    The Harpers have received intel that the ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar
    was in possession of the Green Dragon Mask, and that the Cult of the Dragon
    were on their way to retrieve the same. This led to the death of many Harpers
    as they had clashed with Dragon Cultist forces in the Kryptgarden Forest.

    The mission ended in an utter disaster, and the mask had been taken by the
    Cult of the Dragon leader and green dragon Wyrmspeaker, Neronvain.

- event: King Obould XVIII of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows Dies
  date: 10 Hammer 1489 DR
  description: >
    After a very short reign of 5 years, Obould XVIII who had continued the
    legacy of the continued Obould Dynasty, died in an insurrection that had led to
    another civil war in the Kingdom of Many-Arrows. His son Obould XIX, was said to
    be half-human, groomed by the elder Obould to be his successor.

    Not only was this unheard of, even considering that the line of Obould was already
    strange in the eyes of most orcs, this was seen to be heretical by most--an insult
    to the Blood of Gruumsh. The insurrection itself was justified by this fact, and
    is used by the faction that had led the uprising to solidify their powerbase.

    Surprisingly, many orcish tribes considered Obould XIX their rightful king and
    had continued to fight alongside him. Comparatively though, support for Obould XIX
    is not as large as those who refuse to be ruled by a half-human runt.

- event: Order of the Gauntlet attacks a green dragon nest
  date: 24 Tarsahk 1489 DR

    Reports had led the Order of the Gauntlet to secure and destroy a Green Dragon
    Nest found close to the Long Road that had gone through the Dessarin Valley.

    The nest belonged to a younger sister of Vorgansharax, the Maimed Virulence, who
    had taken over the town of Phlan.

- event: Sacrifices from Finback, Whalebones arrive at the Well of Dragons
  date: 2 Mirtul 1489 DR
  description: >
    Many of the inhabitants of the Whalebones have been magically transported to the
    Well of Dragons. It seemed however, that there was some interference that had
    occured, and thus, only half of the expected number were transported. Because of
    this, and because the Sharrans had separated the children for their own purposes,
    there had not been enough sacrifices to bypass the necessity for forming the
    Mask of the Dragon Queen.

    The Sharrans' recent failings, and the successes of Magna Mistwinter and her
    companions had cast some doubt in the minds of some of the members of the Cult of
    the Dragon. Some, such as the young **Iskander** who had been given the job of
    discovering the secrets of Xonthal's Tower, secretly had wished to return to the
    ways taught by Sammaster that the Dracoliches hold the fulfillment of a prophecy.

    The members of the Reorganized Dark Followers of Shar did not care much for the
    Cult of the Dragon, and only used them as a diversion and a tool to meet their own
    ends. The children they took from the Whalebones was enough to be able to create
    about 50 Bloodmoon Orbs.
