     tube-top and a skirt made of interlocking chains, and magically fastens itself
     to a wearer's body, instantly attuning to their body. It grants its user an AC
     of **16 + DEX (max 2)**. Once the user is attuned, every hour, the user must make
     a DC 15 wisdom saving throw or be in utter sexual arousal. Any article of clothing
     worn by the wearer, except for footwear that extends only below the knee, or
     headgear that covers only up to the nect, will instantly disappear.

     The armor can only be doffed on a successful casting of the  _remove curse_ spell.

     After drinking a vial of Nymph Essence, the creature must make a **DC 15 wisdom
     saving throw**. On a fail, the creature becomes sexually aroused for d12 hours.
     For the duration of arousal, the creature is compelled to provide erotic sexual
     pleasure to a sentient creature that it can see.\n\n

     At the beginning of every hour for the duration of the arousal, the creature may
     make a **DC 15 wisdom saving throw**. On a save, the affected creature is still
     aroused, but is not compelled to provide pleasure for that hour. On three
     successive saves, the effect of the Nymph Essence ends.\n\n

     When the effect of the Nymph Essence ends, the affected creature, and one creature
     it has sex with gains the benefits of a long rest, and loses one level of
     exhaustion.

     A creature with no sexual organs will not be affected.

 Vial of Succubus/Incubus Essence:
   attunement: false
   effect: >
     After drinking a vial of Succubus/Incubus Essence, the creature must make a **DC
     15 wisdom saving throw**. On a fail, the creature becomes sexually aroused for d6
     hours. For the duration the creature also is compelled to provide violent,
     sado-masochistic sexual pleasure to a willing or unwilling sentient creature that
     it can see.\n\n

     If the affected creature is the master of the succubus/incubus that had provided
     the essence, the creature can choose to succeed the saving throw instead.

     At the beginning of every hour for the duration of the arousal, the creature may
     make a **DC 15 wisdom saving throw**. On a save, the sexual arousal effect
     ends.\n\n

     When the effect of the Succubus/Incubus Essence ends, the affected creature, and
     the creature it has sex with gains one level of exhaustion.

     If a vial of Succubus Essence is taken, taking a vial of Incubus Essence, or vice
     versa, the effects of the essences are nullified.

    A creature with no sexual organs will not be affected.

 Orb of Energy (Mythallar):
   attunement: true
   effect: >
     Once a creature is attuned to an Orb of Energy, that creature becomes a conduit
     in which the orb may be charged with raw magic. Once per long rest, the creature
     may be able to store one spell slot equal to its highest spell level.

     If, upon attunement, the Orb of Energy is already charged with a spell slot higher
     than the creature may cast, the user must make a Wisdom (Arcana) check with a DC
     equal to 10 + the spell slot's level. Once attuned, the user must make a Wisdom
     (Arcana) check with a DC equl to 10 + the spell's level.

     If the orb of energy is a Mythallar, it may be charged every day for 30 days with
     9th level spell slots or higher, the orb glows a radiant white light and becomes
     too powerful to hold by hand since it becomes capable of tapping raw magical
     energy directly from the Weave. If a creature touches an active Mythallar, they
     suffer the same effects of a Disintegrate spell.

     Once a Mythallar is activated, it may levitate any inanimate object it is
     attached to with an area within 1 mile in diameter.

     under darkness or is in an area of dim light. The immediate area within a 30-foot
     radius is brightly lit, the following 30 feet is dimly lit. It also grants a +1
     bonus to both attack and damage rolls to melee attacks using it.

     _Rage_, if the user isn’t wearing heavy armor:
      * The user has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
      * The user gains a +2 bonus to melee weapon attack damage rolls.
      * The user gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

     Dexterity saving throws against effects that it can see, such as traps and spells.
     To gain this benefit, the user can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

     _Reckless Attack_, while raging, the user may decide to attack recklessly.
     Doing so gives advantage on melee attack rolls using Strength during the current
     turn, but attack rolls against it has advantage until its next turn.

     _Frenzy_, while raging, the user may expend a charge tomake a single
     melee attack as a bonus action on each of its turns.

     Rage ends if one of the following conditions are met:
     * The user is knocked unconscious.
     * The user’s turn ends and the user had not attacked a hostile creature since
       its last turn.
     * The user’s turn ends without taking damage since its last turn.

     After the user of the Dagger of the Berserker's rage ends, it suffers
     one level of exhaustion.
