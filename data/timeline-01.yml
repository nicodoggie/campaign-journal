- event: Magna Mistwinter arrives at Greenest
  date: 27 Ches 1489 DR
  description: >
    Due to a threat to her life made by some cultists of the Dragon in an inn called
    the Snugly Duckling, Magna Mistwinter, the last of her clan of dragon-slayers,
    made her way to Greenest to lie low for a while. Despite her intentions however,
    she was thrust in the middle of a raid by the Cult of the Dragon on her
    destination. She arrived as Greenest was enveloped in flames.

    Upon her arrival, she spots and saves Linan and Cuth Swift. Cuth, a member
    of Greenest's militia, was severely wounded. His wife Linan and their children
    were helpless without help, especially since there were raiders ravaging the city.
    Thus, Magna had escorted them into Greenest Keep, where the townspeople were 
    fleeing toward.

    However, it seemed that the raiders had begun to surround the keep, in order to besiege
    it. Magna and her quarry needed to carefully sneak into a secret entrance to the side of
    the keep itself.
