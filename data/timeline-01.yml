- event: Edith and Hariq arrive at Boareskyr Bridge
  date: 27 Ches 1489 DR
  description: >
    Travel along the High Road had been slowed due to some damage to the famous
    [Boareskyr Bridge](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Boareskyr_Bridge).\n\n

    A huge typhoon and the resulting overflow of the
    [Winding Water](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Winding_Water) had
    collapsed a large section of the black granite bridge, and thus had been
    rendered impassable to horses, much less carriages.\n\n

    The caravan that Edith Tarnalis, a cleric of Chauntea, and Hariq Ilqalba,
    a nobleman-mage from the deserts of
    [Calimshan](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Calimshan) had travelled with
    was forced to take refuge in one of the many roadside "inns" in the tent-city
    that surrounds the bridge.\n\n

- event: Kidnapping at the Boareskyr Bridge
  date: 27 Ches 1489 DR
  description: >
    Some children in the tent-city that surrounds Boareskyr Bridge had disappeared.
    It seems that kidnapped children is, sadly, not a rare event in the area, due
    to a very active slave market in the Serpent Hills run by the Yuan-Ti.\n\n

    Edith and Hariq had teamed-up to take back these children away from the slavers,
    and had hurriedly followed their trail. What they found, however, was smashed
    carriage and some footprints that seems to indicate that the smugglers and the
    children have fled into the woods that led to the
    [High Moor](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/High_Moor).\n\n

    The team had found themselved chased by a Banshee until they reached a small
    cabin. This cabin, apparently, had also been where the smugglers and the children
    had taken refuge from the same Banshee, who, for some reason, cannot enter.\n\n

    Edith had discovered that the cabin was protected magically, by a consecrated
    dagger dedicated to the dwarven god
    [Haela Brightaxe](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Haela_Brightaxe),
    the Luckmaiden. Hariq, on the other hand, discovered a trapdoor hidden under
    some rubble.\n\n

    Edith had, with Hariq's help, sneaked the children into the trapdoor as she
    removed the consecrated dagger from the alter. This had removed the protection
    of the cabin, and in effect, forced, and had successfully navigated, a battle
    between them, the smugglers, and the banshee.\n\n

    As the team began taking stock of the children they had rescued, however, it
    seems two children have disappeared. These two, one of the children had seen,
    had wanted to explore that lay beneath the trapdoor.\n\n

    Edith had requested that Hariq might return these children to the tent-city
    of Boareskyr, and that she would take the two children back herself. Unfortunately
    however, Edith had soon learned that the two children were taken by some strange
    hooded figures in black robes into an ancient elven temple.\n\n

    As Edith had followed them, she had found that these figures were followers of the
    dark goddess Shar. They had performed a strange ritual that involved opening
    the chest cavities of the children and placing orbs into them.\n\n

    The Harpers have received intel that the ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar
    was in possession of the Green Dragon Mask, and that the Cult of the Dragon
    were on their way to retrieve the same. This led to the death of many Harpers
    as they had clashed with Dragon Cultist forces in the Kryptgarden Forest.

    The mission ended in an utter disaster, and the mask had been taken by the
    Cult of the Dragon leader and green dragon Wyrmspeaker, Neronvain.
