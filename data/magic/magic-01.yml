   level: 0

   description: >
     You brand a willing creature with the symbol of the Arcane Brotherhood. Once
     branded, the caster may be able to scry the exact location of the branded creature.
     The branded creature may also be able to scry the exact location of the caster
     if the caster is willing. If the caster is unwilling, the branded creature may still
     scry the location on a successful Wisdom ability check equal to the caster’s
     Spell Save DC.

 Blood Contract:
   casting_time: 1 hour
   duration: Unlimited
   components: V, S, M (drops of blood, paper and a quill)
   level: 9
   range: Touch
   school: Enchantment
   ritual: true
   description: >
     You magically bind a contract written in the blood of all entities involved in
     its terms. Every item in the contract must be precisely written. If a term can be
     interpreted multiple ways, then the Blood Contract will apply to all of the ways
     a term may be interpreted by the DM.

     If a term or a rule defined in the contract is broken by an entity whose blood is
     bound and no failure condition is defined explicitly, the entity must make a
     Wisdom saving throw once per day while the rule remains broken. On a failure,
     that entity takes 20d6 psychic damage, or half that damage otherwise.
